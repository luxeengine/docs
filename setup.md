To build the documentation we use 
- site generator - https://mkdocs.org
- template/theme - https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/

To get started you need python 3+, and can use pip to install the needed parts:

```
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-exclude
pip install mkdocs-material
```
