# The luxe editor

An introduction to working with the luxe editor.

!!! example "outcome"
    In this tutorial we'll **use the World api** to put something on screen.   
    We'll also use a module, called **Arcade** for handling physics + collision.
    We'll load scenes and create prototype instances to populate a world,
    and create a custom **Modifier**. 

    We'll make a game where you play as a bee, and have to bounce on flowers.
