## Reference a module 

Alongside your `project.luxe` file, there is a file called `luxe.project/modules.lx`. Dependencies on modules can be added to this file, or added via the [launcher](../../tutorial/using-modules/). For example, if you were using a module called `arcade` at version `0.0.23` it would look like this:

```js
  modules = {
    luxe = "2024.8.3"
    arcade = "0.0.23"
  } //modules
```
