## Installing IDE support

Currently the primary supported IDE is [Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).   
It's a free cross platform editor with great support for custom extensions.
The extension includes features like code completion, jump to definition, and so on.

!!! note "Install Code" 
    Download and install Code from the above link for your platform if you haven't.

To install support for luxe, open the extensions panel. 
This is an icon on the side bar, or found via the `View -> Extensions` menu.  

Search the extensions for 'luxe' and when found, select 'install'.   
_(Make sure it's the official one)_.
