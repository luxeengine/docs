# luxe intro tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to cover the core concepts in luxe, 
and introduce them by implementing a point-and-click style experience.

!!! summary "tutorial template"
    Some of the details will be provided by the project outline 
    (like simple movement mechanics), because the focus is on learning
    how to use luxe, and not on programming those specific things.

## wren intro

Note that there's an intro to the [Wren programming language](../../guide/wren-primer) 
which luxe uses. It may be useful in getting familiar with Wren when coming from other languages.  

[Make sure you have code completion running in the Code editor.](../../guide/workflow#code-completion)

## outcome 

The end result is that you have an overview of the various tools that
are provided by the engine, and how you might use them to implement a game.

## concepts

Some of the concepts covered are listed below. The tutorial goes into more.  
Each step is small and self contained, typically able to be completed in a short amount of time.

- creating a new project 
- running the project via code + via editor
- creating entities and attaching modifiers to give them meaning
- creating and loading scenes into the world 
- querying entities from the world 
- giving entities unique data
- using a module in your project for additional tools
- making a build to share with others 
- being aware of coordinate spaces

## editor + simple code

This tutorial is a mix of both **_simple code_** and content created with the editor. Emphasis
on simple code! At the moment the nature of luxe leans toward code, but the tutorial focuses 
on keeping it simple and digestible.
